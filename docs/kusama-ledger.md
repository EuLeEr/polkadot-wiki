> WARNING: The Kusama Ledger application has not been approved by Ledger at the time of writing.
> Until the application is approved, you must either build the application yourself or download a pre-built binary from GitHub. The application is still considered in a development pre-release until an official release happens on the Ledger Live marketplace. Proceed with caution and use a spare development Ledger device if available.

Kusama has a [Ledger][] application that is compatible with the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X devices. 

## Installing the Ledger Application

> NOTE: These instructions are for pre-release only. They will be replaced by the instructions for downloading the applicaton directly from Ledger Live when it becomes available.

Instructions for downloading the prerelease binary from the GitHub releases is written [on the README][prerelease instructions] for the Kusama Ledger application GitHub repository.

On the [releases page][] you can download the file `zxtool.sh` and then make it executable in your shell by typing the command `chmod +x zxtool.sh`. 

Next, you must make sure your Ledger device is plugged in and unlocked and you're using the latest firmware (1.6 at the time of writing). If everything is prepared, then type `zxtool.sh load` and accept the prompts on your Ledger device to install the application.

## Using on Polkadot-JS Apps

[Polkadot-JS Apps][] already has an integration with the Ledger application so that your device will work with the browser interface after installation. The functionality is currently gated behind a feature setting that you will need to turn on.

In order to turn on the interoperability with the Kusama Ledger application, go to the "Settings" tab in Polkadot-JS Apps. Find the option for attachting Ledger devices and switch the option from the default "Do not attach Ledger devices" to "Attach Ledger via WebUSB".

Click "Save" to keep your settings.

Now when you go to the "Accounts" tab you will see a new button that says "Query Ledger". Ensure that your Ledger device is unlocked and you have navigated into the Kusama application, then click this button.

You will not get any feedback from the web page, but if all went fine you should be able to scroll down and find a new account on the page named "Ledger". Under the type column, the account will also show "ledger".

You can now use this account to interact with Kusama on Polkadot-JS Apps and it will prompt your ledger for confirmation when you initiate a transaction.
